Building a Structured Data Cleaning Pipeline for Retail Transactions
Why Data Cleaning Matters
In real-world scenarios, datasets are rarely analysis-ready.
Inconsistent formats, invalid entries, missing values, and logical errors can severely impact analytical results and model performance.

Before any modeling or visualization
a structured data cleaning process is essential.

:heavy_check_mark:  This notebook demonstrates how to transform a messy retail transaction dataset into a reliable and analysis-ready dataset using a systematic pipeline approach.

Data Cleaning Strategy
The cleaning process follows these stages:

Structural Cleaning (duplicates, formatting issues)<br>
Numeric Standardization (currency symbols, type conversion)<br>
Missing Value Handling<br>
Business Rule Validation<br>
Text Standardization (phone, email)<br>
Date Normalization<br>
Final Data Quality Assessment
