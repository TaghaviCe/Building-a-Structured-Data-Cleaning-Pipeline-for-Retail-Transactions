Building a Structured Data Cleaning Pipeline for Retail Transactions
Why Data Cleaning Matters
In real-world scenarios, datasets are rarely analysis-ready.
Inconsistent formats, invalid entries, missing values, and logical errors can severely impact analytical results and model performance.

Before any modeling or visualization
a structured data cleaning process is essential.

Data Cleaning Strategy
The cleaning process follows these stages:

Structural Cleaning (duplicates, formatting issues)
Numeric Standardization (currency symbols, type conversion)
Missing Value Handling
Business Rule Validation
Text Standardization (phone, email)
Date Normalization
Final Data Quality Assessment
